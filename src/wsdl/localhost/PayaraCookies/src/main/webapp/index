establishment of a minimum service requirement under Article 22(3) of the Universal Service Directive, the
authors would like to raise the following issues.</p>
                        <p>In paragraph 188 of the consultation document, the government states that it proposes;</p>
                        <p>‘to implement the changes to Article 22(3) [Universal Service Directive] through a minor amendment to
the Communications Act to give Ofcom the necessary power [to impose minimum quality of service obligations
on electronic communications network and service providers]. On 24 June 2010, Ofcom published a
consultation document on traffic management, where it states that its likely initial view would be to explore
existing competition tools and consumer transparency options before considering using these powers. Ofcom’s
consultation closed on 9th September 2010’. [4]</p>
                        <p>BIS has publicly stated that issues concerning the open Internet and network neutrality are too broad-ranging
and politically important to be left to the regulator. The Minister has recently affirmed, corrected and
reaffirmed his commitment to an open Internet, and claimed to agree with Sir Tim Berners Lee on the
centrality of network neutrality to freedom of expression and Internet innovation. [5] The Impact Assessment</p>
